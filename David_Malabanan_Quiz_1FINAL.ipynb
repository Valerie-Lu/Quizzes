    "This quiz will be credited to Class Participation. It is over 20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Answer the questions below in the code box below the question. Follow the question carefully to avoid unnecessary deductions. If the question asks for a function, provide a function; if it asks for your function to return, then return, not print.\n",
    "2. You are allowed to submit this quiz in groups of 4 (maximum). Indicate your names in the given cell below this instruction cell. You are allowed to answer the quiz with fewer people (or even individually), but this is not recommended for difficulty reasons.\n",
    "3. Elect a group leader. This group leader will upload the group's notebook file to their GitHub repository, then they will send a link to their repository to joben.ilagan@gmail.com at 11:15 AM **at the latest** to accommodate for difficulties in sending the file. The file name should be: **GroupLeaderLastName_Quiz_1.ipynb**. Files sent from 11:16 AM to 12:15 PM will have final scores slashed in half, and files sent from 12:16 PM onwards will not be checked.\n",
    "4. This test is open notes and open internet. However, we may check code against internet sources.\n"

    "The Caesar cipher is a very basic method of encrypting text. This is how to encrypt a message using the Caesar cipher:\n",
    "1. First, pick a message. \n",
    "2. Second, pick a number. \n",
    "3. Shift the alphabet right by the number that you chose.\n",
    "4. Replace each letter in the message with the new letter based on the shifted alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to encrypt \"ABC\" with the number 3, shift each letter right by 3. In this case, \"ABC\" becomes \"DEF\" because D comes 3 letters after A, E comes 3 letters after B, and F comes 3 letters after C. Letters near the end of the alphabet simply wrap around: \"WXYZ\" encrypted with the number 2 would yield the encrypted message \"YZAB\".\n",
